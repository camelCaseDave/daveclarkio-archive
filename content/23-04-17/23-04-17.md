More recently, applications built to integrate with CRM, either as external <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx">SPA</a>s or HTML pages embedded within CRM, have utilised the TypeScript superset of JavaScript. If you're not already using TypeScript, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript">this great StackOverflow answer</a> on why you should consider it (though this answer is general and not specific to Dynamics CRM development).

<p>
One annoyance many developers face when using TypeScript is file layout within the IDE. TypeScript compiles from <b>.ts</b> files to multiple <b>.js</b> files which can clutter file hierarchy layout on the IDE interface. This can be resolved in one of two ways.
</p>

<h3>1. Change your output directory</h3>
Navigate to your <b>tsconfig.json</b> file and specify an output directory that is different to the location of your <b>.ts</b> files. This could be <b>/dist</b> or <b>/build</b>:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "DIRECTORY"
    ...
```

<h3>2. Hide your .js files</h3>
Changing your output directory and moving your .js files can cause issues. For example an <b>index.html</b> page that references <b>main.js</b> will no longer work if you're now compiling to <b>/dist/main.js</b>. You may therefore consider whether you just want to hide your <b>.js</b> files from your IDE.
<p>In Visual Studio Code, go to <b>File > Preferences > Settings</b> or your <b>.vscode\settings.json</b> file and enter:

```json
"files.exclude": {
    "**/.git": true,
    "**/.DS_Store": true,
    "**/*.js" : {
        "when": "$(basename).ts"
    },
    "**/*.js.map": {
        "when": "$(basename)"
    }
}
```

To hide <b>.js</b> files one file directory deeper, add further lines to your .json file with an additional <b>/\*</b>:

</p>

```json
"**/*/*.js": {
    "when": "$(basename).ts"
},
"**/*/*.js.map": {
    "when": "$(basename)"
}
```
