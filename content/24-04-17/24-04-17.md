Typically, when we want to deactivate a record in a plugin or a workflow, we turn to <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.setstaterequest.aspx">SetStateRequest</a></b>. Qualifying a Lead isn't quite as straightforward. If you've qualified a Lead through the CRM interface, you'll know that:

<ul>
<li>An Opportunity is created from the originating Lead.
<li>You can select whether to create a Contact or Account from the originating Lead.
</ul>
<b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.qualifyleadrequest.aspx">QualifyLeadRequest</a></b> in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.aspx">Microsoft.Crm.Sdk.Messages</a> namespace provides us with a class which allows us to specify all of these options and more programatically.

<p>
The code snippet below creates a new <b>QualifyLeadRequest</b>, populating all of it's required properties.
</p>

```cs
var qualifyLeadRequest = new QualifyLeadRequest
{
    // The Lead record to qualify and its status once qualified.
    LeadId = new EntityReference(),
    Status = new OptionSetValue(2),

    // Specify whether or not to create an Account, Contact and/or Opportunity.
    CreateAccount = true,
    CreateContact = true,
    CreateOpportunity = true,

    // The currency to use for the Opportunity.
    OpportunityCurrencyId = new EntityReference(),

    // The Account or Contact that will be associated with the Opportunity.
    OpportunityCustomerId = new EntityReference(),

    // The source Campaign that will be associated with the Opportunity/
    SourceCampaignId = new EntityReference()
};
```

Replace all of my empty <b>new EntityReference()</b> objects with valid EntityReferences (which are instantiated by passing an entity name and an ID). Refer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.qualifyleadrequest.aspx">Microsoft documentation</a> for information on other optional parameters which you can use.

</p>

The request is executed and its response stored in the <b>qualifyLeadResponse</b>:

```cs
var qualifyLeadResponse = (QualifyLeadResponse)service.Execute(qualifyLeadRequest);
```

The most interesting property of the response object is <b>CreatedEntities</b>. See the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.qualifyleadresponse.aspx">Microsoft documentation</a> for information on other properties stored in the QualifyLeadResponse.

<p>
<b>CreatedEntities</b> contains a collection of EntityReferences, one for each entity created when qualifying the Lead. To get the Contact that was created, for example, iterate through the collection and query the <b>LogicalName</b> of each EntityReference:
</p>

```cs
foreach (var entity in qualifyLeadResponse.CreatedEntities)
{
    if (entity.LogicalName == "contact")
    {
        // TODO.
    }
}
```
